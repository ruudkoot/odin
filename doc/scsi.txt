 Storage-related SCSI commands are defined mainly in the SCSI Architecture Model
 (SAM), SCSI Primary Commands (SPC), and SCSI Block Commands (SBC):

    - SAM defines the SCSI systems model, the functional partitioning of the
      SCSI standard set, and the requirements applicable to all SCSI
      implementations and implementation standards.
    - SPC defines behaviors that are common to all SCSI device models.
    - SBC defines the command set extensions to facilitate operation of SCSI
      direct-access block devices.
